# ML_HealthCare_IBM

## Introduction:
Diseases such as heart attack, breast cancer, and diabetes have a significant impact on public health. Early detection and accurate prediction of these diseases play a crucial role in improving outcomes for individuals. Leveraging the power of machine learning, the ML-HealthCare project aims to provide a web-based application that visualizes different aspects of these diseases and predicts the likelihood of an individual having them. The ML-HealthCare project is a web-based application developed using Python's Streamlit library. It offers a user-friendly interface where individuals can explore disease-related information and receive predictions based on their input parameters. The project focuses on three major diseases: heart attack, breast cancer, and diabetes.

## Objective:
1. Develop a web-based application using the Streamlit library to provide an interactive platform for disease analysis and prediction.
2. Visualize and analyze various aspects of heart attack, breast cancer, and diabetes through interactive charts, graphs, and data visualizations.
3. Implement machine learning models to predict the likelihood of individuals having heart attack, breast cancer, or diabetes based on user-provided input parameters.
4. Contribute to early detection and prevention of heart attack, breast cancer, and diabetes, ultimately improving public health outcomes.

## Dataset:
1. Heart Attack
2. Diabetes
3. Breast Cancer
